# C

**High-level programming language** means some kind of bridge between the human language and the computer language.

**Portability** is a feature of high level programming language. The programs written in high-level languages could be translated into any number of different machine languages and make them usable on many different computers.

It's commmon for a file containing the source code in the C language to have its name ending with the suffix `.c`.

**Executable file** is a file containing our program translated into machine language which was compiled by a compiler. Most compilers designed for the Unix/Linux system create an output file named `a.out` by default. Compilers designed for Windows makes the same name as the source file but changing the suffix from `.c` to `.exe`.

**Linking** is the phase of gluing the different executable codes. **Linker** is the program which conducts linking process.

Knowing the C language is very helpful if you want to learn C++, C# or Java. The time spent learning the C language won't be wasted.
