  - Some language elements have proved to be inconvenient or confusing
  - New programming techniques have appeared in the meantime
- When the first version of C programming language were designed and implemented, its authors were focused on creating a tool that allowed the easy implementation of a new operating system
  - For PDP-11 computer by a company named Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)
