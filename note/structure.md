# Structure

Structure contains any number of elements of any type.

Each of these element is called a **field**. The field name must be unique.

**Struct tag** is the name of the structure, capital letter by convention.

```
struct STUDENT {
  string name;
  float time;
  int recent_chapter;
};
```
