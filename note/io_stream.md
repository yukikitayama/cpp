- C++ uses a stream as an interface between the program and input and output devices
- It's sequence of bytes
- Header files
  - `iostream` for from/to streams
  - `fstream` for from/to file streams
  - `iomanip` manipulators to format stream I/O
- Stream classes
  - `ios`
  - `ifstream`
  - `ofstream`
  - `fstream`
