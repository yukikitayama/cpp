# Object-oriented programming

## Introduction

- The data and the code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes.
- Each class is like a recipe that can be used when you want to create a useful object.
- Create a template which is a generalized, parameterized class for vary requirements and different situations to be used.

## Object

- An object is a being belonging to a class
- An object belonging to a specific class belongs to all the superclasses at the same time.

## Superclass vs subclass

- Subclass is more specialized or more specific than its superclass
- Each superclass is more general or more abstract than all its subclasses.

`class <subclass-name>:<superclass-name> {};`

## Inheritance

- Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy inherits all the traits defined inside any of the superclasses.

## Encapsulation

The ability to hide (protect) selected values against unauthorized access. Neither accessed or modified if use exclusively.

`private:` to make variables inaccessible from outside, but it's by default.

`public:` accessible to users of a class.

`<class-name>::<class-outsite-function-name>` implements class method outside the class.

**Constructor** uses the name same as the class name.

**Property (member variable)** is data of object

**Method (member function)** is function of object
