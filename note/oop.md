# Object-oriented programming

## Introduction

- The data and the code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes.
- Each class is like a recipe that can be used when you want to create a useful object.

## Object

- An object is a being belonging to a class
- An object belonging to a specific class belongs to all the superclasses at the same time.

## Superclass vs subclass

- Subclass is more specialized or more specific than its superclass
- Each superclass is more general or more abstract than all its subclasses.

## Inheritance

- Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy inherits all the traits defined inside any of the superclasses.

**Property (member variable)** is data of object

**Method (member function)** is function of object
