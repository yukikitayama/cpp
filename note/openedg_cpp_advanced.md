Introduction
- Standard Template Library (STL) provides ready-to-use solutions for many programming problems.
- Every C++ compiler is accompanied by STL
- As long as you use STL, your program portability is high
- STL can be divided into **Containers** and **Algorithms**.

- **Containers**, or collections, are meant to contain something inside.
- An array is a very basic container
