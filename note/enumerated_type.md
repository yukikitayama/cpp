# Enumerated type

The C++ language pre-processor offers a method to create symbols which will be replaced by their values during compilation time. 

`#define symbol string`. The pre-processor will automatically replace each occurrence of the `symbol` with the `string`. 

`symbol` is upper-case letters by convention to distinguish from regular variables

`string` is a series of characters.
