## Introduction

C++ language grew as an object extension of its ancestor C programming language. It's an incremented (`++`) version of C. It's incremented because it's filled with many new options unavailable to its ancestor.

## Modern C++

C++11 (2011), C++14 (2014), C++17 (2017) are called **modern C++**. Pre C++11 standards are called classical C++.
